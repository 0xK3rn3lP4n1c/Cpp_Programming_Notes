/*** If you have a program with lots and lots of classes you wouldn't want to put them all in the same text file So we are going to put the classes 
in seperate files. note if you're using DevC++ you have to create a new project to creat a class for some reason. Go ahed and do that after that on 
the File tab press add and add a class. For default we don't want an instructor and a destructor so if its selected deselect it. After that give your 
class a name. Make sure your class and code is in the same directory
